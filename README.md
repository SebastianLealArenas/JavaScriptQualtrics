# JavaScriptQualtrics
Hi! This is the JavaScript to capture reaction times I used in the papers dealing with RTs. I integrated it into Qualtrics and it required a few extra steps to make it work.

Once your survey is complete, go to Survey Flow (Survey > Survey Flow), click on 'add a new element' and select Embedded Data. 

Click on the little arrow beside 'Create New Field or Choose From Dropdown...,' select 'Survey Metadata' and click on 'Embedded Data.'
